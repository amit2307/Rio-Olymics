<h2><p>The 2018 Winter Olympics, officially known as the XXIII Olympic Winter Games , and commonly known as PyeongChang 2018,<br />
 is a major international multi-sport event scheduled to take place from 9 to 25 February 2018, in Daegwallyeong-myeon, South Korea.
The elected host city was announced on 6 July 2011 by the International Olympic Committee (IOC), after the 123rd IOC Session in Durban,<br /> 
South Africa. Other candidates that applied to host the games were Annecy, France and Munich, Germany. Pyeongchang won on its third consecutive</br />

It will be the first Winter Olympic Games and second Olympic Games in South Korea; the 1988 Summer Olympics were held in Seoul.<br /> 
Pyeongchang will also be the third East Asian city to host the Winter Games after Sapporo, Japan (1972), and Nagano, Japan (1998);<br />
 and the first Winter Games in Continental Asia.</h2></p>
